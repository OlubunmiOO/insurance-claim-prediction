The objective of this analysis is to understand the building characteristics
that influence whether a building will experience at least one insurance claim
during its insured period.
pandas as pd
matplotlib.pyplot as plt
seaborn as sns
df = pd.read_excel("../data/Train_data.xlsx")
df.head()
Python
df.info()
df.describe()
Dataset contains building-level records
Target variable: Claim
Mixture of numerical and categorical features
4️⃣ Missing Values & Duplicates
Python
df.isnull().mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
df.duplicated().sum()
Insight example (markdown):
Some building attributes contain missing values, which must be handled carefully to avoid bias during modeling.
5️⃣ Target Variable Distribution
Python
df['Claim'].value_counts(normalize=True).plot(kind='bar')
plt.title("Claim Distribution")
plt.ylabel("Proportion")
plt.show()
Insight:
The dataset shows class imbalance, with fewer buildings experiencing claims. This makes ROC-AUC a more appropriate metric than accuracy.
6️⃣ Key Risk Insights (Examples)
Python
sns.boxplot(x="Claim", y="BuildingAge", data=df)
plt.show()
Python
sns.countplot(x="BuildingType", hue="Claim", data=df)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
Business interpretation:
Older buildings show higher claim likelihood
Certain building types are more claim-prone
